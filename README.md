# Description
This repository is a collection of coding assignments and projects throughout my undergraduate and graduate coursework. This repo is not a comprehensive list of all my courswork coding assingments, however, the majority of my graduate work and a large portion of my undergraduate work related to dynamics and control have been preserved here.
