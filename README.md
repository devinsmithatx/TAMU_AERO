## Description
This repository is a collection of coding assignments and projects related to dynamics and control / GNC. This repo is not a comprehensive list of all my coursework coding assingments, however, the majority of my graduate work and a portion of my undergraduate work have been preserved here. These assignments contain simulating dynamics, characterizing vehicle performance, orbital mechanics, control law and filter design, and other related work.
